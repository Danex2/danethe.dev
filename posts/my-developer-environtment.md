title: 'A short overview of my dev environment'

I've gone through many different developer setup since I've started coding. From Windows to Linux to Mac and then back to Windows again. I've been fairly
impressed with the efforts Microsoft has been making recently and also realized that the operating system doesn't really matter much to me personally when
it comes to programming. Below you will find what I typically use on a day to day basis when doing web development.


### Editor - VSCode

I don't think this should be a surprise since this is probably the default choice when making applications for the web. Also there are thousands of themes/plugins
to choose from that make life a lot easier. The font I am using is [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) and the theme is [Ayu Mirage Bordered](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu).

### Terminal - CMDer

At first I didn't really like CMDer, it just felt really plain to me after using things like oh-my-zsh. You can change the theme and play around with it to make it
look less bland but I've decided to just leave it as it is. I know the new Windows Terminal is supposed to be a lot better now and I've tried playing around with
it and customizing it to my needs but it felt like a ton of work to get things working correctly. The ease of making my terminal pretty is probably the only thing I
miss from Linux/Mac OS. CMDer does get the job done though so I can't complain.


### Browser(s)

I tend to switch up which browser I use from month to month but right now I'm using Firefox. No particular reason just thought I'd give it a whirl for a bit. Some other
browsers I've used are Chrome, Opera and Edge.

### Computer/Laptop

For work I use a 2019 13inch Macbook Pro. Initially I didn't really like the touchbar but its grown on me. I'm not sure whether I hate the keyboard or not but I've
been okay using it day to day for work.

My home setup is a little more beefy, I use it for gaming, streaming, recording videos and programming.

Component | Name
------------ | -------------
CPU | AMD Ryzen 3700x @ 4.0Ghz
Motherboard | MSI B450-A Pro Max
GPU | Sapphire Nitro RX580 8G
Ram | 2x Corsair Vengeance 3200Mhz
Power Supply | EVGA 650W
Storage 1 | WD 1TB NVme
Storage 2 | Samsung 840 EVO 500GB
Case | Corsair 275r

### Conclusion

This is what my current developer setup is at the moment, in the future I may go back to MacOS as my main operating system but for now this is what is working for me.
